            <p> Welcome to my coding journey. Since I decided to embark on this path to becoming a Front-end web developer I've noticed a significant change in my attitude when I wake up each morning. I feel truly dedicated to and intellectually stimulated by the limitless universe of code. </p>
            <p> I have only just begun - but really there is no beginning or end to anything. The world we live in IS creation. Our universe IS creation. As i write this more universes have been created with their own sun, solar system and moon (or equivalent). Sure there is en end to life - but only as we define it and what we define as an "end." Coding is limitless - like we are. We are code and I hope to go into this further on the next assignment. Thank you." </p>
